# RNASeq Workshop
This repository contains a walkthrough of how to analyze RNA-Seq data, using a sample dataset from Bernal et al. 2020 (*Science Advances*). This repository will be used in the RNA-Seq data analysis workshop held at UT Chattanooga from August 10-12, 2022.

This workshop was made possible by funding provided to Fernando Alda from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. 

The sample datasets used in this analysis are publicly available on NCBI. The version of the *A. polyacanthus* genome used is available at accession number GCF_002109545.1. The raw RNA-Seq reads are available under NCBI BioProject Number PRJNA489934 and SRA accession number SRP160415. We thank the following authors of the study that generated this dataset: Moises Bernal, Celia Schunter, Robert Lehmann, Damien Lightfoot, Bridie Allan, Heather Veilleux, Jodie Rummer, Philip Munday, and Timothy Ravasi, as they have graciously allowed us to use their data (Bernal et al. 2020, *Science Advances* 6(12): eaay3423).
